Estimating pose...
Using COCO_133 model (body, feet, hands, and face) for pose estimation in lightweight mode.
If you set device or backend to 'auto', you must set the other to 'auto' as well. Both device and backend will be determined automatically.

Valid MPS installation found: using ONNXRuntime backend with GPU.
Persons detection is run every 2 frames (pose estimation is run at every frame). Tracking is done with sports2d.
1 person is analyzed. Person ordering method is highest_likelihood.
keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3
Skipping head angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the pose estimation model: ['Head', 'Neck'].

Video processing completed.
Reordered persons: IDs of persons [1] become [0].

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Rejecting outliers with a Hampel filter.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to /Users/giacomo/dev/rowing-video-analysis/sports2d_app/runs/gb8_20260203_210816/sports2d/input_Sports2D/input_Sports2D_px_person00.trc.

Converting pose to meters:
The Head marker is missing from your model. Considering Neck to Head size as 1.33 times Neck to MidShoulder size.
Could not estimate the floor angle, xy_origin, and visible from person 0. Make sure that the full body is visible. Using floor angle = 0°, xy_origin = [960.0, 540.0] px, and visible_side = right.
Converting from pixels to meters using a person height of 1.95 in meters (manual input), and of 802.00 in pixels (calculated).
Perspective effects corrected using a camera-to-person distance of 10.00 m (obtained from a manual input).
Camera horizon: 0.00°, corrected using gait kinematics.
Floor level: 540.00 px (from the top of the image), gait starting at 960.00 px in the right direction for the first person. Corrected using gait kinematics.

- Person 0: Seen from the front.

Post-processing angles (without inverse kinematics):
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Rejecting outliers with a Hampel filter.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Correcting segment angles by removing the 0.0° floor angle.
