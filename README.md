# rowing-dynamics-analysis

Tools for analyzing rowing video, starting with a pose/kinematics extraction pipeline.

## Current module

- `pose-extraction-test/`: offline pipeline for stabilization, crop tracking, 2D pose, optional 3D lift, and angle overlays.

## Notes

Generated outputs (videos, `.npz/.npy`, etc.) and local assets (venv, source videos) are intentionally not committed.
